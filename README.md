This is my Fitness Tracker developed with HTML/CSS, and JavaScript for frontend and PHP for backend.

I hope this app helps people like me who have been lifting weights for a while and find it difficult to keep motivation high. This graph at the top of this app perfectly show your growth and effort!!

These are the images of the index page since I skip the deploy process...
